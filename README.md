# Lacat - Smart Wallets

Lacat allows you to securely store your funds in a timed safebox (`Lacat.sol`).

After depositing, you can only withdraw your funds after a given point in time in the future that you specify.
This lets you stop worrying about losing your funds or panic-selling.

In case you need emergency access, you can optionally specify what portion of your funds can be withdrawn each month.
For example, you could set the unlock date to be 2 years from now, but allow withdrawing 0.5% of your funds every month
in case you need it. There is no other way to withdraw earlier.
